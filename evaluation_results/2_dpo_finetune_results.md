- **问题**: Who is the Dutch football manager and former centre-forward footballer who was signed by FC Bayern Munich in the 2003–04 season?
- **标准答案**: `Roy Makaay`
- **生成答案**: Based on the information provided, the Dutch football manager and former centre-forward who was signed by FC Bayern Munich in the 2003–04 season is not explicitly mentioned as having both roles simultaneously. However, from the details given:

1. Roy Makaay was signed by FC Bayern Munich in the 2003–04 season and was a centre-forward.
2. Giuseppe Meazza became a football manager after his playing career.

Since there is no direct mention of a player who fits both criteria (being a Dutch centre-forward signed by FC Bayern Munich in the 2003–04 season and later becoming a manager), we can conclude that the specific individual fitting both roles is not directly stated in the provided information. 

If we had to choose based on the given data, Roy Makaay fits the first part of the description but not the second. Therefore, the question as posed does not have a clear answer based on the provided information. If you have additional context or another player in mind, please provide more details.
